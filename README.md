The Rules of the Moves

The pieces can move in both horizontal and vertical directions.
If the player has more than one piece, the player should make two subsequent moves
with different pieces.

Capturing Pieces

If the player's single piece or group of pieces are between the wall and the opponent
piece, they are captured.
